This is the project folder for project 2 of FYS-STK4155. .


To reproduce: Just run all codes by doing "python "filename.py"", and all the plots in the figs folder should be recreated as is.


Mains:

p1.py holds the gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent functions. These were produced when I took the class last year, and the implementation of GD seems to be incorrect, but i did not manage to remake it into something that worked properly.

p2.py holds the neural network linear regression plotting.

p2_classification.py plots the classification analysis using the neural network.

log_reg.py holds the logistic regression function and analysis.



Other codes:

functions.py is something i have from project 1 that was finished last year, it holds some functions needed for p1.py.

NN.py, cost.py, activation_functions.py, and scheduler.py contain codes made by Morten Hjorth-Jensen for the course. They are all gathered from the lecture notes posted on github.



Sadly, the codes are not properly commented and look messy. This is due to time constraints because of a period of sickness in the weeks before handing in the project.


Hope this finds you well.
