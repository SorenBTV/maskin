This is the project folder for project 3 of FYS-STK4155. .


To reproduce: Just run all codes by doing "python "filename.py"", and all the plots in the figs folder should be recreated as is.


Mains:

foo.py plots the classification analysis using the neural network.

lin_reg.py plots the classification analysis using linear regression.

decision_tree.py provides results from classification analysis using a plain decision tree and XGBoost.



Other codes:

NN.py, cost.py, activation_functions.py, and scheduler.py contain codes made by Morten Hjorth-Jensen for the course. They are all gathered from the lecture notes posted on github.



Hope this finds you well.
