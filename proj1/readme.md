This is the project folder for project 1 of FYS-STK4155. All codes are contained in the "source" folder,
figures generated by the source code are stored in the "figures" folder, and the finished report is
contained in the "report" folder.


To reproduce: All the codes in the "source" folder, except from 3dplot_terrain.py, need to be run to
get the plots contained in \figures and the delivered project pdf.



Hope this finds you well.
